# Base64 Python .py file Obfuscator

### Current Version : v1.0.1

### 
```diff 
- ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES 
```


The Code can encode / obfuscate an python file (.py). It will not only obfuscate the input file but it will also add about 10 mb of random data, the python script will still work like usual but the code is not recognizable with naked eye or for someone who doesnt have basic knowledge of these things. Can be used for Hacking. _It will always check for an update and notify you if there is one_ so **it Will give an error when you execute it without any wifi**.

## Installation

You only need python3, I made it so that you dont need to install extra library's
You can also download it from My website : [Thomasthehacker's site](https://thomasthehacker.github.io)
## Usage

```python
python3 main.py
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Coming up
- Working on an automatic updating system
- More customization for the User (like settings which also can be saved into the json file)
- Maybe make an option to just encrypt single strings from base64 and to base64, They wont be able to execute but more as an encoder / decoder option
